Should consider before sending that “I quit!” email that you’ve been fantasizing about:

Identify a problem that you feel driven to solve.

Starting a business is not easy, and scaling it is even harder. But the strongest fuel is a personal connection to what you’re doing. It could be that you have experience working in an industry and understand its shortcomings firsthand. Or perhaps you’re part of a consumer segment that’s underserved by the current offerings. Maybe you’re simply met with a very specific frustration every day, that others are sure to share. However you come to your idea, you should feel like you have no choice but to start this particular business at this moment in time. It will make the mornings when you wake up and wish that it was someone else’s problem much easier to bear.

Consider your role as founder.

More than ever, people care deeply
 about who’s behind the companies
 they’re purchasing from. 
It’s hard to feel a personal 
connection to a nameless, 
faceless corporation, and far more
 rewarding to support brands that
 are built by individuals with a 
compelling story. Particularly on
 social media, so many brands gain 
traction by having their founders 
front and center as part of the 
narrative: speaking to their 
experiences, demonstrating 
humility and vulnerability, 
and putting a human face to the business. 
This doesn’t mean that in order to start a 
company you need to be prepared to be a public
 persona who reveals every aspect of your private life.
